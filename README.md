# Mega Golf

Mega Gold is a competitive realtime multiplayer mini golf game. We made this game as part of our
capstone project for Fullstack Acadamy's fulltime web development bootcamp. This game was inspired
by many of the "io" games that exist on the internet like, [Agar.io](https://agar.io/), [slither.io](http://slither.io/), and [skirbbl.io](https://skribbl.io/).
